## Project_Builder project rules

### 1. Project context

- This is the **Project_Builder** project workspace.
- Project structure follows standard development patterns with support for multiple project types.

### 2. Folder structure

- `src/` - Source code for single-service projects
- `apps/` - Application components for multi-component projects
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `scripts/` - Utility and automation scripts
- `tests/` - Test files and test utilities
- `infra/` - Infrastructure as code, deployment configurations
- `tasks/` - Task definitions and project management files

### 3. Development guidelines

- Follow the patterns established in this workspace (see `CLAUDE.md` in parent directory).
- Use appropriate project structure based on project type:
  - Multi-component projects: Use `apps/`, `infra/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` at root
  - Web app monorepos: Use `apps/web/`, `apps/api/`, `packages/` structure
  - Single-service backends: Use `src/config/`, `src/routes/`, `src/services/`, `src/models/`, `src/lib/`

### 4. Communication preferences

- Explain things in plain English first, before using technical terms.
- Provide short, step-by-step instructions.
- Specify where commands should be run (PowerShell on Windows).
