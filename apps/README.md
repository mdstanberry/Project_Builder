# apps/

This directory contains application components for multi-component projects.

## Structure

Each application or service component should have its own subdirectory:

```
apps/
  component-name/
    [component-specific files]
    tests/
      [test files]
```

## Usage

Use this directory when building projects with multiple components, services, or applications that work together.

Examples:
- Frontend and backend applications
- Multiple microservices
- Agent-based systems
- CLI tools and web interfaces
