# tests/

This directory contains test files and test utilities.

## Structure

Organize tests to mirror your source code structure:

```
tests/
  unit/          - Unit tests
  integration/  - Integration tests
  e2e/          - End-to-end tests
  fixtures/     - Test data and fixtures
  helpers/      - Test utilities and helpers
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests alongside your code
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Maintain good test coverage
